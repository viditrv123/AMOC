In the current world scenario seeing the vast spread of CORONA in countries, this is my contribution and an attempt to help the society.

**My Work Consists of**
1) Use of HERE API for maps.
2) Tensoreflow.js to find the approximate no. of cases of CORONA in a location.
3) Node.js

**Assumptions & Limitations**
1) All the Hospitals displayed on the map are capable of treating CORONA patient since we don't have data of CORONA treatable hospital.
2) Since the data set of the CORONA patient was small therefore the value of the confirmed cases remain same for over a vast area within the state,
